annote = {What : Wheeled robotic system which navigates along outdoor “trails” intended for hikers and bikers
Detect and track rought paths despite widely varying tread material, border vegetation, and illumination conditions
        
How : Use appearance and structural cues from stereo camera and lidar. The approaching trail region is efficiently segmented in a top-down fashion based on color, brightness, and/or height contrast with flanking areas, and a differentialmotion planner searches for maximally-safe paths within that region according to several criteria. When the trail tracker’s confidence drops the robot slows down to allowa more detailed search, and when it senses a dangerous situation due to excessive slope, dense trailside obstacles, or visual trail segmentation failure, it stops entirely to acquire and analyze a ladar-derived point cloud in order to reset the tracker
        
Contribution : Here we present a fully integrated system which uses appearance and structure,not just from stereo but from ladar as well, to find and track the trail in real time. Previous iterations of the system moved at a constant speed regardless of trail or obstacle geometry; now the robot can detect loss-of-trail, excessive slope, or dan- gerous obstacle events to slow down and even stop in order to more deeply analyze the situation before proceeding. Finally, the differentialmotion planning system has been updated to lessen the likelihood of collisions while still preserving a basic impetus for forward motion. These changes have yielded vast improvements in the operational performance of the robot in many real-world situations
        
Results : Our system’s ability to negotiate a variety of challenging trail types over long distances is demonstrated through a number of live runs through different terrain and in different weather conditions
